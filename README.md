# TF2Benchmarker
An Automated Team Fortress 2 Benchmarker

![Main View](Screenshots/Main.png "")

### Setup

To begin, you need:
- A Team Fortress 2 installation.
- **(Optional)** FPS config to benchmark from.
- A demo, placed in the `tf` directory, to benchmark against.
- A list of commands to benchmark.

### Usage

1. Remove any configs that could interfere with the benchmark (usually autoexec.cfg)
2. Set your TF2 path to your `Team Fortress 2` directory (Usually steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2).
3. **(Optional)** Set your DirectX level.
4. Load an existing FPS config or use the default TF2 configuration.
5. Load or add commands to benchmark. The file format for loading benchmarks is described below.
6. **(Optional)** In the `Benchmark List` and `FPS Config` tabs, uncheck values you don't wish to use.
7. Specify the demo to benchmark.
8. Start the benchmark.

### Keys

`Shift + F2` will stop a benchmark while it is running. TF2 will not immediately close, instead it will just finish the current command and stop. The `TFBench` window does not need focus for this to work.

`Alt + S` will start and stop benchmarking while the window is in focus.

### FPS File Format

Any file with the extention `.cfg` can be imported to use as a 'base' to bechmark against.

Comments `//` should be automatically ignored, as well as mixed use of `" "`s.

### Benchmark File Format

To quickly add commands to benchmark, you can place your commands in a `.txt` file.
Each line will be parsed for a command, and benchmarked separately.
```
example_command 1
example_command "2"
// Both of these are accepted, comments like this are ignored
```

If you want to run multiple commands simultaneously, you can do so in the following format:
```
Name to display | example_command 1 | example_command 2 | example_command 3  ...
```

Working examples can be found in the `Benchmark Examples` folder.

### Process

Every time you start a benchmark, the program will perform the following steps:

1. Back up any existing `cfg/config.cfg` and `sourcebench.csv` files.
2. A clean config.cfg will be generated, based on the following:
  * If the `Default` option is selected, the game will be started with the `-default` parameter.
  * If the `Custom Config` option is selected, checked commands from the `FPS Config` list will be written to `/tf/custom/tfbench/cfg/autoexec.cfg`
3. The game is started, the DirectX level is set (if needed) and a benchmark is run with the clean configuration.
4. For each command in the list, an `autoexec.cfg` will be generated with that command combined with the FPS config (if used).
  * Conflicts between existing commands and the benchmark values will be automatically resolved.
5. Each command is benchmarked, with a restart between each command.
6. Results are parsed from the `sourcebench.csv` file, and displayed in the results tab.
7. Backed up files are restored, and temporary files are removed.

### Pitfalls

When benchmarking, it is important to note that there are a number of factors that can skew results.

* Ensure that you close out all applications that could interfere with the benchmark. These include internet browsers, VoIP applications, etc.
* Under normal conditions benchmarking can result in variations of Â±2-3 fps between identical runs. Keep this in mind while evaluating results.
* Keeping `-dxlevel` in the launch options can negatively affect performance, and cause crashes. Remember to remove it once you've set your DirectX level to the desired value.

### Known Issues

There seems to be a noticeable performance improvement between the first and subsequent benchmarks when the game is not restarted in between. This might be due to caching speeding things up, or it could be the result of the steam cloud or other external factors overwriting settings. In any case, it needs more investigation.
