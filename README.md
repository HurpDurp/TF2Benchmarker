# TF2 Bench
An Automated Team Fortress 2 Benchmarker

![Main View](Screenshots/Main.png "")

### Setup

To begin, you need:
- A Team Fortress 2 installation.
- **(Optional)** FPS config to benchmark from.
- A demo, placed in the `tf` directory, to benchmark against.
- Commands to benchmark.

### Usage

1. Remove any configs that could interfere with the benchmark (usually autoexec.cfg)
2. Set your TF2 path to your `Team Fortress 2` directory (Usually steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2).
3. **(Optional)** Set your DirectX level.
4. Load an existing FPS config or use the default TF2 configuration.
5. Load or add commands to benchmark. The file format for loading benchmarks is described below.
6. **(Optional)** In the `Benchmark List` and `FPS Config` tabs, uncheck values you don't wish to use.
7. Specify the demo to benchmark.
8. Click start.
9. View the results in the `Results` tab.

### Keys

`Shift + F10` will stop a benchmark while it is running. TF2 will not immediately close, instead it will just finish the current command and stop. You should hear a sound after pressing it.

`Alt + S` will start and stop the benchmark. The TF2 Bench window must be in focus, unlike the command above.

`Alt + B` will run a baseline benchmark.

`Alt + P` will open the dialog to select the `Team Fortress 2` folder.

### FPS File Format

Any standard FPS config can be loaded and used alongside of a benchmark.

### Benchmark File Format

To quickly add commands to benchmark, you can place them in a `.txt` file, with a command on each line.

Example:
```
my_command 1
my_other_command "2"
// Both of these are accepted, comments like this are ignored
```

Each command will be benchmarked separately.


If you want to run multiple commands at the same time, you can do so in the following format:
```
Name to display | a_command 1 | b_command "value" | c_command 3  ...
```

More examples can be found in the `Benchmark Examples` folder.

### Technical Info

Each time you start a benchmark, the program will perform the following steps:

1. Any existing `cfg/config.cfg` and `sourcebench.csv` files are backed up.
2. If needed, a baseline benchmark is created. During this phase:
  * The game is started.
  * The DirectX level is set.
  * If the `Default` option is selected, the game is started with the following parameters:
  ```
  [DirectX Level] -default -timedemo_comment "Baseline" [Custom Launch Options] +timedemoquit [Demo Name] 
  ```
  * If the `Custom Config` option is selected, the `default` parameter is not included and the FPS config is copied to `tf/custom/tfbench/cfg/autoexec.cfg`.
  * TF2 generates a clean `config.cfg` using the command `host_writeconfig`.
  * The game exits.
3. The main benchmark session starts.
  * For every command in the `Benchmark` list, an `autoexec.cfg` will be generated with the command combined with the FPS config (if used).
  * If the FPS config contains the same command as the one being benchmarked, it is overridden.
  * If the `Run Twice` box is checked, the `timedemo_runcount` launch parameter will be set to `2`, and the first `timedemo` result will discarded to ensure consistency. Is is highly recommended that you use this option.
  * The game is started with the following launch options:
  ```
  -timedemo_comment [Command Name] [Custom Launch Options] +timedemo_runcount [1/2] +timedemoquit [Demo Name] 
  ```
  * The game exits, and starts up again to benchmark the next command.
4. Results are parsed from the `sourcebench.csv` file, and displayed in the results tab.
5. Once finished, backed up files are restored, and temporary files are removed.

### Getting Accurate Results

* Ensure that you close out all applications that could interfere with the benchmark. This include internet browsers, VoIP applications, etc.
* Under normal conditions, results can vary between Â±2-3 fps between identical runs.
* Keeping `-dxlevel` in the launch options can negatively affect performance, and cause crashes. Remember to remove it once you've set your DirectX level to the desired value. Do **not** manually set the directx level when using TF2Bench, instead use the DirectX version selector.
* The benchmark cannot run twice in once session when using the `-default` launch parameter ([#5](/../../issues/5)), thus baseline results when using the `Default` option may be inaccurate.
