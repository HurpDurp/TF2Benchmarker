# TF2Benchmarker
An Automated Team Fortress 2 Benchmarker

![Main View](Screenshots/Main.png "")

### Setup

To begin, you need:
- A Team Fortress 2 installation.
- **(Optional)** FPS config to benchmark from.
- A demo, placed in the `tf` directory, to benchmark against.
- A list of commands to benchmark.

### Usage

1. Remove any configs that could interfere with the benchmark (usually autoexec.cfg)
2. Set your TF2 path to your `Team Fortress 2` directory (Usually steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2).
3. **(Optional)** Set your DirectX level.
4. Load an existing FPS config or use the default TF2 configuration.
5. Load or add commands to benchmark. The file format for loading benchmarks is described below.
6. **(Optional)** In the `Benchmark List` and `FPS Config` tabs, uncheck values you don't wish to use.
7. Specify the demo to benchmark.
8. Start the benchmark.

### Keys

`Shift + F10` will stop a benchmark while it is running. TF2 will not immediately close, instead it will just finish the current command and stop. The `TFBench` window does not need focus for this to work.

`Alt + S` will start and stop benchmarking while the window is in focus.

### FPS File Format

Any file with the extention `.cfg` can be imported to use as a 'base' to bechmark against.

Comments `//` should be automatically ignored, as well as mixed use of `" "`s.

### Benchmark File Format

To quickly add commands to benchmark, you can place your commands in a `.txt` file.
Each line will be parsed for a command, and benchmarked separately.
```
example_command 1
example_command "2"
// Both of these are accepted, comments like this are ignored
```

If you want to run multiple commands simultaneously, you can do so in the following format:
```
Name to display | example_command 1 | example_command 2 | example_command 3  ...
```

Working examples can be found in the `Benchmark Examples` folder.

### Process

Every time you start a benchmark, the program will perform the following steps:

1. Any existing `cfg/config.cfg` and `sourcebench.csv` files are backed up.
2. The game is started, the DirectX level is set (if needed) and a benchmark is run with the clean configuration.
  * If the `Default` option is selected, the game is started with the following parameters:
  ```
  [DirectX Level] -default -timedemo_comment "Baseline" [Custom Launch Options] +timedemoquit [Demo Name] 
  ```
  * If the `Custom Config` option is selected, the following parameters are used:
  ```
  [DirectX Level] -timedemo_comment "Baseline" [Custom Launch Options] +timedemo_runcount [1/2] +timedemoquit [Demo Name]
  ```
  Additionally the FPS config is copied to `tf/custom/tfbench/cfg/autoexec.cfg`.
3. A clean config.cfg is written using the command `host_writeconfig`.
4. The game exits.
5. For every command in the `Benchmark` list, an `autoexec.cfg` will be created with that command combined with the FPS config (if used).
  * Conflicts between existing commands and the benchmark values will be automatically resolved.
6. The game is started.
  * If the `Run Twice` box is checked, the benchmark will be run twice per command, with the first result discarded to ensure    consistency.
  * The following launch options are used:
  ```
  -timedemo_comment [Command Name] [Custom Launch Options] +timedemo_runcount [1/2] +timedemoquit [Demo Name] 
  ```
7. Results are parsed from the `sourcebench.csv` file, and displayed in the results tab.
8. Once finished, backed up files are restored, and temporary files are removed.

### Pitfalls

When benchmarking, it is important to note that there are a number of factors that can skew results.

* Ensure that you close out all applications that could interfere with the benchmark. These include internet browsers, VoIP applications, etc.
* Under normal conditions benchmarking can result in variations of Â±2-3 fps between identical runs. Keep this in mind while evaluating results.
* Keeping `-dxlevel` in the launch options can negatively affect performance, and cause crashes. Remember to remove it once you've set your DirectX level to the desired value. Do **not** manually set the directx level when using TFBench, instead use the DirectX version selector.
